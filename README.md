# Long Short Vowels Detection  
A fun simple console app for long/short vowels detection made with .net.  
  
Needs more data or list of long/short vowels. Currently it's very limited  
  
Note: There are no average correctness/incorrectness to the results as it depends to how much data feeded into the dictionary. You should add your own math based on the average results pulled out of the dictionery
